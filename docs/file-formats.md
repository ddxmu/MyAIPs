# File formats: registry, per-format quirks, PSB, document alpha

Read before changing format I/O, open/save filters, notices, or alpha/mask import.

## Registry and dispatch

- `builtin_format_registry()` (format_registry.cpp, function-local static) is the single instance. `load_document_from_path` (main_window.cpp) consults it BEFORE the QImageReader fallback; a throwing registry read still falls back to Qt where a Qt plugin exists, but if Qt also fails the REGISTRY error is reported. Handlers may be read-only (`write == nullptr`) and may carry a `sniff` check; sniffing disambiguates `.ase` (Aseprite magic 0xA5E0 at offset 4 vs Adobe `ASEF` swatches; the error points swatch files at the Palette panel).
- One filter table: `file_format_entries()` (main_window_files.cpp) generates open/save/export filters, `is_supported_image_extension`, `save_file_filter_for_path`, and `path_with_default_extension`. Display names sit in `QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP("QObject", ...)` and are shown through `translate_data_text`; run `scripts\update-translations.ps1` and fill every catalog when adding one ([localization.md](localization.md)).
- A new format needs one table row, one registry row, one writer branch.

## Open-dialog filter contract

Open, sprite-sheet, and image-sequence dialogs pass `FilterNameDetails::Hidden` through `get_open_file_names`. File > Open (and the Open Recent Folder entries) is multi-select: each picked file opens as its own document in dialog order and the last one is active, the same loop a multi-file drop runs (`ui_open_dialog_opens_every_selected_file`). Qt shows only the text left of the last `(` and uses the final parenthesized list as the machine filter, so `open_file_filter()` writes each row as `Name (patterns) (patterns)`. The duplication is deliberate: the machine-readable patterns are the LAST parenthesized list, the rest is the visible name.

The visible portion must keep a `*.` token. The Windows 11 native dialog appends the complete semicolon-joined pattern list to any filter name without one, so the all-formats row uses the short `(*.psd *.png *.jpg and more)` hint instead of ~50 patterns. `ui_open_dialog_hides_name_filter_details` pins the shape.

Desktop file drops copy the accepted local paths and queue processing on the main
window after the drop handler returns. Never enter import dialogs or decode files
inside the native drop callback: Windows Explorer waits for that callback and
would remain blocked for the lifetime of a RAW or PDF dialog. Main-window, canvas,
tab-area, and floating-window drops share this path. Files retain their drop order;
cancelling one import still permits the remaining files to open. Destroying or
closing the main window before delivery discards the queued work.

## Per-format catalogue

Everything reads AND writes except camera raw, HEIF/HEIC, and .af (read-only); JPEG XR reads and writes on Windows only. Modules live in src/formats/, Qt-free, explicit-endian via `binary_le.hpp` (LE) or `psd_binary.hpp` (BE).

- PSD/PSB: PSB section below plus [ps-compat.md](ps-compat.md); 16/32-bit files convert to 8-bit on import (section below).
- BMP: includes 32-bit `BI_RGB`/compression 0, whose 4th byte Patchy keeps (feeds document-alpha import below).
- ICO/CUR: every embedded size imports as a hidden layer named "WxH"; the writer reuses a matching "WxH" pixel layer verbatim, so sizes round-trip. 256px entries are PNG-compressed via `ico::set_png_codec` (installed in the MainWindow ctor). CUR hotspots ride layer metadata `patchy.cursor_hotspot`.
- TGA: types 1/2/3/9/10/11, both origin flags; 15/16-bit rejected; palette-mode documents write type 1 indexed.
- GIF: Patchy-owned encoder for single frames and animations; reading stays with Qt's qgif, so the Windows package must ship `imageformats/qgif.dll` (build-release.bat `CopyRequiredImageFormatPlugins`). Opening a 2+ frame GIF imports every frame as a visible layer, frame 1 on TOP (the reverse of the sequence/sprite-sheet convention, so open-then-save round-trips), each delay stamped as a trailing seconds token ("Frame 3 0.4s") that the animated save parses back (`gif::format_delay_seconds_token` / `parse_layer_name_delay_cs`; other animated formats and the pattern library stay first-frame-only). Save As / Export .gif on a 2+ layer document raises `prompt_gif_save_options` (animation from visible layers vs single flattened image, default frame delay; keys `saveOptions/gifSaveMode`, `saveOptions/gifFrameDelayCs`; an explicit animation choice skips the flatten warning but keeps save-a-copy semantics); File > Export Layers as Animated GIF is the always-animation form and stays visible on wasm. Animated writes (`write_animated_gif_file`): visible top-level layers top to bottom through `render_layer_isolated`, per-frame quantization (`indexed_rgba8_quantized`/`indexed_rgba8_with_palette`), NETSCAPE2.0 loop forever, disposal restore-to-background, global color table = frame 1 with local tables for later frames, no dithering. LZW width growth uses the pre-increment check; `gif_encoder_bytes_are_stable` pins the single-frame bytes, which the animation path never touches. The layers panel's film button previews the animation in-app (see [layer-panel.md](layer-panel.md)).
- Aseprite: frame 1 only; layer tree/blend modes/opacity round-trip; zlib cels via vendored `src/formats/miniz/`; verified against the real Aseprite CLI. Aseprite is the layered alternative in Save As.
- PCX: 8-bit indexed EOF-palette plus 24-bit 3-plane RLE.
- ILBM/PBM: ByteRun1 via the shared `psd::decode_packbits`/`encode_packbits_row` (psd_descriptor.{hpp,cpp}); EHB supported, HAM rejected; writer emits planar ILBM with masking type 2.
- PNG/JPEG/TIFF/WebP: Qt readers/writers. WebP has its own options dialog: quality (`saveOptions/webpQuality`, default 75 = Qt's own) and lossless (`saveOptions/webpLossless`, sent as quality 100, which Qt's plugin encodes losslessly).
- JPEG XR (.jxr/.wdp/.hdp): read AND write through the in-box WIC codec, Windows only (no Store package, no vendored codec); the filter row is gated on `jxr::is_available()` so no other platform offers it, and the registry row carries a WRITER, which is what keeps Save on .jxr instead of routing to Save As. Float/HDR frames (NVIDIA captures are 32-bit float scRGB) tone map to 8-bit with a knee curve rather than clamping. Full record, including the curve calibration and why a filmic curve was rejected: [jxr.md](jxr.md).
- Proton `.rttex` (Seth's Proton SDK textures): read and write everywhere. An optional RTPACK zlib wrapper around raw 8888/888/4444/565 pixels stored bottom-up at a power-of-two padded size, or an embedded JPEG (alpha-free images only); opens at the true size; PVRTC rejected. Options, session-metadata prefill, and the RTPack parity table: [rttex.md](rttex.md).

## Camera raw (CR2/CR3/NEF/ARW/RAF/DNG, ...)

Read-only LibRaw import through `raw_document_io.{hpp,cpp}`. Decoder, precision,
licensing, per-photo sidecars, defaults, and tests: [camera-raw.md](camera-raw.md).
The dialog refines drafts into accurate previews and saves adjustments beside
the source. Automated filename opens read those sidecars without writing them.

## HEIF/HEIC (.heic/.heif/.hif)

Read-only; decoded only by an OS- or browser-supplied decoder. **Never ship a software HEVC decoder or encoder**: the reviewed patent boundary in [legal-constraints.md](legal-constraints.md). Encoding stays impossible everywhere: no registry writer and `write_flat_image_file` rejects HEIF extensions (a QImageWriter plugin could otherwise encode HEVC silently). Implementation details live in `heif_document_io.{hpp,cpp}` + per-OS variants; ftyp-brand sniff, HEVC brands only, AVIF rejected.

- Windows (the real decoder): WIC via the Store's HEIF + HEVC packages. A stub codec is ALWAYS registered, so availability cannot be enumerated: attempt the decode and map failures (component-not-found at creation = HEIF package missing; codec-not-found at pixel request = HEVC package missing). These errors carry `heif::k*PackageMissingMarker` prefixes that the open-failed box turns into an "Open Microsoft Store" button. WIC returns UNROTATED pixels; apply `heif::apply_exif_orientation`. ICC (iPhone = Display P3) converts to sRGB via `IWICColorTransform`.
- macOS/Linux: `read_heif` always throws; the QImageReader fallback decodes (qmacheif / kimg_heif). kimg_heif ATTACHES P3 without converting, so the fallback bakes heif-family images to sRGB via `convertToColorSpace` (scoped to heif).
- Browser WASM: vendored libheif 1.23.1 parses (`webcodecs` plug-in only); the browser `VideoDecoder` decodes after `isConfigSupported()` with the file's `hvc1.*` profile; deliberately no fallback decoder, and never gate on browser name/version. libheif links only into `wasm-release`; NOTICE-THIRD-PARTY.md records the LGPL details.
- Flatpak: HEVC decode lives in `org.freedesktop.Platform.ffmpeg-full//24.08`; single-file BUNDLE installs never auto-pull it (verified 2026-07), so the error dialog shows the install command (packaging/linux/README.md). The remote Linux test machine [SKIP]s heif tests.
- Tests: statistics only, never byte pins (lossy HEVC + per-platform CMS); [SKIP] on known codec-unavailable messages, hard-fail otherwise. `ui_heif_open_is_read_only_if_available` needs the repeating-QTimer dismisser via `reject()` so the Store button can never fire.

## .af (Affinity)

Read-only importer; registry id `patchy.formats.af`, sniff on magic `00 FF 4B 41`; the filter row claims `.af` plus 2.x `.afphoto/.afdesign/.afpub`. The full format record (container/FAT resolution, legal method boundary, tier model, placement/vector/text/effects mapping, blend-mode approximations, Erase folding, fixtures) moved to [af-format.md](af-format.md); field-level wire layouts are documented in af_document_io.cpp beside each parser.

## PDF

Import and export (flat and editable-layers modes) live in [pdf.md](pdf.md). PDF has no registry row and is a read-only source; the filter-string and save-guard rules below still apply to it.

## Layered documents and flat formats (the Photoshop-style save guard)

A document opened from a flat format that has grown structure a flat save would discard must never silently flatten back over its file:

- `flat_save_discards_layers(document)` (main_window.cpp): more than one layer, any group/adjustment/text/smart-object layer, a hand-authored mask, or layer styles. A single pixel layer whose only mask carries the document-alpha marker stays exempt (that mask IS the flat file's alpha plane).
- `save_extension_preserves_layers()` lists the guard-skipped formats: psd/psb, aseprite/ase, and ico/cur (exempt on purpose: multi-size icons live as hidden "WxH" layers, so every icon save would otherwise false-positive).
- Save on a layered flat-backed document routes to Save As, defaulting name and filter to `.psd`.
- Explicitly choosing a flat format raises `flattenLayersMessageBox` (default Cancel) and on confirm performs a save-a-copy: the flat file is written but the session keeps its path, title, and modified state. Save As pre-confirms and passes `flatten_confirmed` so the box appears once.
- Exception: a linked smart-object child session keeps real-save semantics after the same warning (the linked file IS that document; the parent refresh needs the write).
- Pins: `ui_save_layered_flat_format_routes_to_save_as_with_psd_default`, `ui_flat_save_of_layered_document_warns_and_saves_copy`.

## Shared writer helpers

`formats/document_flatten.{hpp,cpp}`: `flatten_document_rgba8` (mask-aware: a document-alpha layer exports non-destructively), `indexed_flatten_for_palette_mode` (document palette in file order, exact-then-LUT, appended transparent slot: PNG-8 semantics), `indexed_flatten_quantized` (median-cut fallback for RGB docs; GIF + ILBM share it). Both indexed functions delegate to PixelBuffer-level `indexed_rgba8_with_palette` / `indexed_rgba8_quantized` so the animated GIF writer can index each frame separately with identical semantics.

The UI hands `QString` paths to the Qt-free readers and writers through `to_filesystem_path` (`ui/qt_paths.hpp`; see the path rule in `AGENTS.md`), and `formats/format_file_io.cpp` `rename_first_layer_to_stem` names the imported layer in UTF-8 through `path_to_utf8`.

Everything except PSD/Aseprite flat-exports through `write_flat_image_file`. `ImageSaveOptions` carries the EXPORT-only transforms, never Save/Save As: the shared dialog section (on every export form except ICO/CUR) persists them under its own `saveOptions/exportScale`, `exportResize`, `exportResizePercent`, `exportFillTransparent`, `exportBackgroundColor`, `exportTrim`, and `exportRevealInFileExplorer` keys so option defaults never inherit one (JPEG forces the fill and does not persist it; PDF editable layers disable the section). `export_stand_in_document` applies them in order: trim (alpha != 0 bounds; an all-transparent image keeps its size plus a notice), resize (`scale_pixels_resampled`, bilinear; `export_width/height` describe the FULL canvas so a trimmed export scales by the same factors, one zero side follows the aspect), nearest-neighbor `export_scale`, then the background fill (straight-alpha matte, opaque result). The stand-in keeps the doc-alpha mask structure and palette metadata unless matted; all-default options take the old byte-identical path; PPI copies verbatim. The animated GIF writer applies the same per frame, trimming to the union of all frames' bounds. File > Export Flat Image... is Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S (`file.export_flat`).

## PSD adjustment layers and clipping masks

- Curves presets (`.acv`) via `formats/acv_curves_io`: big-endian, 2..19 ordered byte points per curve, output-before-input; reads v4, both legacy v1 shapes, and the indexed `Crv ` extension; export writes PS 2026's v4 five-curve RGB shape with the trailing identity curve. Native PSD Curves shares the v1 body parser.
- Imported adjustment layers get canvas-sized bounds: Photoshop writes an empty rect, which renders as unbounded but starves rect-based canvas/undo invalidation.
- Every modeled adjustment kind reads and writes a native Photoshop block: `levl`, `curv`, `hue2`, `blnc`, `nvrt`, `post`, `thrs`, `brit` (payload layouts beside the parsers). A native block overrides a stale `plAD` on load; fresh saves emit native blocks ONLY. Unedited payloads re-emit byte-for-byte, edits regenerate. Posterize models levels 2-255 (destructive dialog keeps 2-16), Threshold 1-255 (destructive 0-255); both share their pixel formula with the destructive filters (core/adjustment_layer): calibrated-destructive math, not claimed byte-identical PS output. `photoshop-{invert,posterize,threshold}.psd` pin round trips.
- Color Balance (`blnc`, 20-byte fixed payload): Patchy models MIDTONES only and patches in place; fresh layers write PS's midtones-only zero template. Nonzero shadows/highlights or preserve-luminosity raise a "preserves but does not render" notice. Rendering is a flat per-channel shift approximating PS's tonal-weighted math. Legacy plAD-only files read and migrate on save. Fixtures: `photoshop-color-balance{,-full}.psd`.
- Brightness/Contrast: legacy-mode PS writes ONLY the 8-byte `brit`; modern mode writes an all-zero `brit` plus a `CgEd` descriptor ('means'/'useLegacy' are stringIDs, the rest charIDs). A parseable `CgEd` beats `brit` on read. Both algorithms are modeled via `use_legacy` (modern ranges -150..150 / -50..100, legacy -100..100 both; brit-only files load legacy; new adjustments default modern). Edits regenerate `brit` plus a PS-2026-shape `CgEd` (imported descriptor fields preserved, else defaults), EXCEPT legacy settings on a file that never carried a descriptor stay brit-only (a stale `CgEd` would win over `brit` in Photoshop). Calibration and native `curv` rules: [adjustments-calibration.md](adjustments-calibration.md). Fixtures: `photoshop-brightness-contrast-{legacy,modern}.psd`, `photoshop-curves-{masked,clipped}.psd`.
- `plAD` is read-only legacy; nothing writes it anymore (the unknown key made Photoshop warn, and its odd 143-byte payload desynced PS's even-rounded block walk). Native `levl`/`hue2` carry every modeled value except the Levels dialog's selected channel tab, which only ever rode `plAD`. The frozen v4 layout stays readable (`parse_patchy_adjustment`); saving migrates to the native block and drops `plAD` (`should_skip_layer_block`).
- `hue2`: imported raw payload preserved in `unknown_psd_blocks`, suppressed from raw re-emission; fresh layers emit the byte-exact PS fresh-layer template. The six per-hextant band records ARE modeled and rendered (`HueSaturationAdjustment::bands`); only the undocumented 36-byte trailer stays patch-in-place, so unedited layers round-trip byte-identically. Hue: -180..180 in the file, 0..360 in the model.
- Hue/Saturation renders through calibrated tables in core/adjustment_layer.cpp (colorize + master, byte-quantized lightness stage, 1530-step hue wheel). Formulas and accuracy: [adjustments-calibration.md](adjustments-calibration.md). The destructive menu path and Affinity `HsRA` import share this math.
- The clipping byte round-trips (`Layer::clipped()`; group/divider records write 0) and clipping masks RENDER: base + consecutive clipped siblings composite in isolation (`IsolatedClipGroupTarget`) and merge with the base's blend mode/opacity. Every sibling-iteration site must go through `composite_sibling_layers`, never a raw children loop, or clipped runs render independently. A clipped adjustment layer adjusts only its group. `clbl` is preserved raw (`clbl=false` renders as if true); clipped flags above groups/adjustments or at the bottom of a list render unclipped defensively. `.aseprite` saves drop the flag.
- Fill Opacity = the 4-byte `iOpa` block; authored 100% omits it. Fill affects base content and adjustment strength, not layer effects; group Fill is ignored. Color Burn, Linear Burn, Color Dodge, Linear Dodge, and Difference use PS's special Fill kernels, not a master-opacity multiply. Nondefault-Fill clipping bases record content coverage separately so effects do not become the clipping shape. Aseprite cannot store Fill; Patchy warns before discarding.
- Advanced Blending "Channels" = the `brst` block: big-endian u32 channel indices EXCLUDED from compositing, no count prefix (PS writes ascending, omits when everything blends). RGB indices 0-2 map to `Layer::restricted_channels()`; the writer regenerates from the model (an imported EMPTY block drops on resave). Non-RGB indices or a malformed payload import preserved-raw only (unsupported flag, warning, dialog checkboxes disabled). Rendering: [ps-compat.md](ps-compat.md). Fixture pair: `photoshop-channel-restrictions.psd/bmp`.
- Layer origins are preserved verbatim, however far off-canvas (the old origin clamp silently SHIFTED content). Corruption guard: |origin| <= 2^23. `psd_far_offcanvas_layer_keeps_true_origin` pins it.

## Damaged PackBits scanlines

Real legacy PSDs carry corrupt RLE scanlines and Photoshop still opens them, so image-channel readers recover instead of failing. `decode_packbits_scanline` (psd_descriptor.cpp) is the lenient decoder every layer, composite, and saved-channel row goes through: an overrunning run is clipped, a short scanline keeps zeroes, and the result is always exactly the channel width. Each row's declared byte count still positions the stream, so a damaged row cannot desync later rows (Photoshop abandons the channel at the first bad row; Patchy resyncs on the row table, verified against PS 2026 on a real corrupt file). Readers count recovered rows; `append_damaged_row_notice` emits ONE notice per document. Everything else (patterns, brushes, filter effects, ILBM) keeps the strict `decode_packbits`, whose exact-length contract catches genuine misparses.

Damaged-structure caps (September 2026): the header is validated before anything sizes a buffer from it (zero or over-limit canvases are refused; PSD 30,000, PSB 300,000 per side), layer and mask rectangles are formed in 64-bit and refused past the PSB limit, descriptor nesting (`Objc`/`VlLs`/`ObAr`) stops at 64 levels with an error (each level was a C++ stack frame, so a 25 KB crafted block overflowed the loader thread), item counts are checked against the remaining bytes before any reserve, and group nesting is capped at 64 (Photoshop allows 10): deeper boundary records are flattened into the deepest kept group and their folder records dropped.

PSD channels/extra data use bounded sub-readers. PSD/PSB writing caps expanded
native layer records, including group boundaries, at Photoshop's limit of 8000.
Empty documents save a transparent placeholder without changing the live
tree. PCX/ILBM validate encoded length; PCX and strict PackBits cap their initial
reserve and grow as runs decode. Aseprite cels also grow as decoded. JXR float decode uses bounded WIC row batches.

## Import notices

Readers report dropped/approximated features via `FormatReadResult::notices` (plain English; the formats lib is Qt-free). `open_document_path` shows them in the STATUS BAR by default (first note plus "+N more"); the consolidated `importNoticesMessageBox` popup appears only when `imports/showPsdWarningsAndInfo` is enabled (the same preference that gates the PSD compatibility report). Tests assert `statusBar()->currentMessage()`; only tests that ENABLE the preference need the REPEATING QTimer dismisser (a one-shot fires during the open-progress phase and the suite hangs).

Blend If: layer records keep their original blending-ranges payload in `Layer::raw_psd_blending_ranges()`. Valid native 40-byte RGB shapes render and edit on pixel, adjustment, and folder records; a range edit patches the known 32 bytes and preserves the identity tail; fresh identity settings write the historical zero-length payload (default-writer canary unchanged). Malformed, partial, non-RGB, and nonidentity-tail shapes stay preview-locked and byte-preserved until the user replaces them. A folder's synthetic closing record keeps its own `raw_psd_group_boundary_blending_ranges()` payload (PS writes a 40-byte identity there): always preservation-only with a precise warning; folder controls edit the visible folder record only.

Layer styles: imported `lfx2`/`lrFX` blocks stay byte-identical until that layer's style is edited. Satin is parsed, rendered, and editable; edited Satin regenerates PS's native 12-field `ChFX` descriptor with its non-anti-aliased Linear contour. Custom contour curves and contour anti-aliasing stay byte-preserved while untouched (the dialog warns that editing normalizes them). Group layer effects render as of July 2026 (COM-calibrated rules in [ps-compat.md](ps-compat.md)). Gradient Overlay and gradient Stroke preserve, render, and edit each stop's native `Mdpn` midpoint without changing the private `plFX` version.

## Fixtures and verification

Committed fixtures live under `test-fixtures/<format>/` (provenance in NOTICE-THIRD-PARTY.md); adversarial files are synthesized byte-by-byte in-test. The PSD set includes `photoshop-satin-default.psd`, `photoshop-layer-style-4a-roundtrip.psd` (PS-resaved acceptance), and `photoshop-blend-if-4b-roundtrip.psd` + `-render.bmp` (native Blend If + render acceptance). Writers were verified with independent decoders (Pillow, Qt, real Aseprite, a from-scratch Python ILBM reader, Photoshop COM): keep doing that for format changes.

## PSB (large document format) read + write

PSB threads `Header::large_document` / `WriteOptions::large_document` through psd_document_io: u64 section/layer-info/channel lengths, u32 RLE row byte counts, header version 2. Save As offers `.psb`; writing a >30k px document as `.psd` errors ("use .psb"; the PSB cap is 300k). Facts pinned against Photoshop 2026 (COM byte-diffs) that the spec gets wrong or omits:

- Tagged-block length width on read = '8B64' signature OR (PSB and the key is in the documented 8-byte list). BOTH rules, not either alone: PS writes 'cinf' as 8B64+u64 in PSBs (not in the spec's list), but PS 2023 writes 'lnk2' as plain '8BIM' + u64 (spec-list key, no 8B64 signature); the signature alone misreads that length and silently derails the rest of the global block walk (`psb_linked_smart_objects_parse_lnke_if_available` pins it). `UnknownPsdBlock::long_length` records each preserved block's width for re-emit; the writer's upgrade list (`tagged_block_length_is_u64`) = spec set + 'cinf'.
- PS pads the PSB layer-info section to 2 bytes (same as PSD), not 4.
- Old Photoshop writes EMPTY layers (0x0 rect) with zero-length channel data: no payload, no 2-byte compression marker. The reader treats a zero-length channel as empty instead of erroring (interface_mock2.psd is a real 2018 example).
- CMYK documents carry CMYK colors in three places, all converted to sRGB through ONE shared path so effect/text colors match the converted pixels: pixel channels (stored inverted), lfx2 'CMYC' effect colors, and text engine `/FillColor` ink fractions. With an embedded CMYK ICC profile (resource 1039) all three convert through vendored lcms2 (`CmykToRgbTransform`; relative colorimetric + black point compensation, PS's defaults); without one, the naive ink mix rgb = 255*(1-ink)*(1-black); no default profile is bundled (Adobe profiles may only ship embedded in image files). The CMYK profile is never promoted into `color_state()` and is stripped from RGB re-exports. Accuracy vs PS's ACE engine: [ps-compat.md](ps-compat.md). Known gap: legacy 'lrFX' ignores the color-space id. Fixture: `photoshop-cmyk-style-colors.psd`.
- The default-false PSD writer paths are pinned byte-identical by `psd_layered_writer_bytes_are_stable` (FNV hash canary; re-pin only for deliberate format changes).

## 16-bit and 32-bit PSD/PSB import (converted to 8-bit)

Patchy's pixel pipeline is 8-bit only: deep files convert every channel at decode time (`convert_channel_to_8bit` in psd_channel_data.cpp), saving writes an ordinary 8-bit file, and an import notice states the conversion. Pinned against Photoshop 2026 COM fixtures and a CS4-era file:

- 16-bit samples are full-range big-endian u16 (0..65535, NOT the 0..32768 pattern-resource scale); conversion is value/257 with rounding. 32-bit samples are big-endian linear-light floats: color channels clamp to 0..1 and sRGB-encode (matches PS's default Exposure and Gamma conversion on the probe colors); transparency, masks, and saved channels scale linearly instead.
- Deep files keep an EMPTY standard layer-info section; the real layers live in the `Lr16`/`Lr32` document-global tagged block (`read_layer_info_records` parses both). The block is consumed, never preserved: re-emitting a stale deep block (or `Mt16`/`Mt32` data) from a converted 8-bit save would mislead Photoshop. An 8-bit file with an empty standard section and a `Layr` block parses the same way. The legacy top-to-bottom order heuristic is skipped for these blocks. The merged-transparency flag is the sign of the block's layer count (`read_merged_transparency_flag_and_skip_layer_mask`).
- Layer channels decode zip (2) and zip-with-prediction (3) besides raw/RLE; prediction-undo details beside the decoder. PS writes zip-with-prediction for non-empty deep layer channels.
- Composite-section RLE rows are plain PackBits at every depth, NO prediction; zip composites stay rejected. A deep file saved without Maximize Compatibility carries an all-white composite (PS behavior, not a bug); the layers are authoritative.
- Local untracked fixtures: `ps2026-{16,32}bit[-flat].psd` (COM-generated; expected values sampled via COM) and `Flat-filter-list.psd` (CS4-era 16-bit). Tests: `psd_16_bit_*`, `psd_32_bit_*`, `psd_photoshop_{16,32}_bit_fixtures_load_if_available`.

## Saved PSD channels and flat-image alpha

PSD/PSB saved alpha and spot channels are ordered, full-canvas `DocumentChannel` planes: not layer masks, never changing the normal composite. Model and UI rules: [channels.md](channels.md). Wire rules:

- A negative layer count structurally marks the first extra composite plane as merged transparency; the reader never exposes that plane in the Channels dock. Every remaining plane after the source color components becomes a saved channel, regardless of name.
- Layered writes emit RGB, optional merged transparency (present only when the layered composite has transparent pixels), then every document channel. The header's channel total stays at or below 56; excess is an error, never silent discard. Opaque documents with no saved channels keep the historical byte-stable writer path.
- Image resources 1006 (legacy Pascal names), 1045 (Unicode names, authoritative), 1053 (identifiers for saved ALPHA channels only: advance its index only for alpha channels), and 1007/1077 (display info) travel in the same order as their planes. Opaque display records travel WITH their channel so reordering cannot detach spot metadata; imported spot records stay opaque-preserved while spot editing is unavailable.
- Raster layer masks stay layer channel `-2`, including masks that began as flat-image alpha; the old `"Alpha 1"` name heuristic and marked-mask promotion are NOT used for layered saves. Group masks ride the folder divider record the same way (mask-data block plus `-2` channel, matching PS); a mask-less group keeps its historical zero-channel record.
- A non-PSD flat image's meaningful per-pixel alpha becomes an editable grayscale layer mask via `promote_flat_alpha_to_layer_mask` (one ordinary pixel layer only; skips uniform alpha, text, smart objects). `kLayerMetadataDocumentAlpha` is the non-destructive flat-export marker: `document_alpha_rgba8` keeps covered RGB values intact when writing one-alpha-plane formats. PSD imports bypass the promotion.
- Layered saves with canvas transparency write PS's merged-alpha shape: straight RGB plus coverage, resource name `"Transparency"`, negative layer count. `psd_layered_write_keeps_merged_transparency_in_composite` and the real Content.psb regression keep it from becoming a phantom saved channel or layer mask.
