# Release process

How to cut and publish a Patchy release. Read this in full before bumping a version or running any release batch file. The per-change build/test handoff (every code change must refresh `build\release\patchy.exe`) is separate and lives in AGENTS.md.

## Version bump checklist

Desktop packages include `patchy-mcp` and the assembled `patchy-control` skill.
Staging and resource paths are specified in [ai-control.md](ai-control.md). Each
desktop packaging script runs the installed connector's `--check` smoke test;
Windows signs both executables and macOS deploys Qt for both. The remote build
helper caps builds at six jobs and runs builds/tests with lower priority.
The Flatpak packager also runs its sandbox build at lower priority with six jobs.

When bumping the release version, update the version fields:

- `CMakeLists.txt` (`project(... VERSION x.y)`)
- `latest_version.json` — the per-platform `version` entries: windows always; macos/linux only when those artifacts actually ship. This is the update-check manifest served to the app from raw.githubusercontent.com on main, and only takes effect once pushed.
- The `<release>` tag in `packaging/linux/com.rtsoft.patchy.metainfo.xml`
- The latest-release line in `README.md`'s Download section, with the published
  version and release date matching the newest "What's New" entry.
- A new top entry under `README.md`'s "What's New" section for that version,
  dated with the release date and summarizing the user-visible changes.
- Keep only the two newest release entries in `README.md`. After adding the new
  entry, move the entry that has become third-newest to the top of
  `RELEASE-HISTORY.md`, preserving its date, wording, order, and author credits.
  Keep the `[Older releases](RELEASE-HISTORY.md)` link immediately after the two
  README entries. `RELEASE-HISTORY.md` stays newest-first and must not duplicate
  either release still shown in the README.

## What's New author credits

Always credit the correct author on each "What's New" bullet, including entries
moved to `RELEASE-HISTORY.md`. Seth is the default and is left uncredited; any
feature or fix contributed by someone else must name them with a GitHub handle
link like `([@handle](https://github.com/handle))`. Check `git log`'s author for
the commits behind each bullet (e.g. `git log --format='%an %s'`) rather than
assuming, and when one bullet mixes work from more than one person, credit the
specific clause that person wrote (see the existing 0.10/0.12 entries in
`RELEASE-HISTORY.md` for the mid-bullet style).

## Build and upload order

Before publishing, run both full native suites and the full
`tests/mcp_client_tests.py` suite on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Repeat the MCP
suite against each staged desktop package, including inside the Flatpak sandbox;
install the current user bundle and run `tests/flatpak_mcp_tests.py` on the Linux host to verify attachment between
separate app and connector sandboxes using their default endpoint.
The packagers' `--check` smoke tests do not cover the full protocol or attachment
lifecycle. Use isolated offscreen workspaces and run test processes sequentially
on each machine. See [testing.md](testing.md) for the client dependency and commands.
WebAssembly does not ship `patchy-mcp`; build both web variants and run the full
wasm core suite.

Build order matters: finalize the README first (the Windows zip/installer embed a copy), then `scripts\release\release-all.bat` (four consoles: local Windows and wasm builds plus remote mac/linux; every builder deletes its previous artifacts up front so a failed build can never leave stale files for the upload scripts), then `scripts\release\upload-to-rtsoft.bat`.

`build\package` must never hold a previous version's files once a new build starts (Seth, September 2026). The mac and Linux builders write versioned artifacts (`Patchy-<version>.dmg`, `Patchy-<version>.flatpak`); the upload scripts copy the newest one over the published names `PatchyMacOS.dmg` and `PatchyLinux.flatpak` and upload that copy, so those unversioned files are upload staging copies of whatever shipped LAST. `release-mac.ps1` and `release-linux.ps1` delete them along with the old versioned artifacts, and the Windows packager deletes its own final-named outputs before rebuilding. An agent that builds packages by hand must do the same delete before reporting the folder as release-ready.

## A bad build must not be able to ship quietly

Two failure modes used to look exactly like success, both found in September 2026 while publishing a macOS-only release. Do not reintroduce either shape.

**Unsigned artifacts.** Signing was gated on credentials being present and merely printed "signing skipped" otherwise, so a missing `~/.patchy-release-env` (mac) or `RT_PROJECTS` (Windows) produced an unsigned build that a long log made invisible. Both sides now fail instead: `packaging/macos/make-dmg.sh` errors under `PATCHY_REQUIRE_SIGNING=1` (set by `scripts\remote\release-mac.ps1`) and additionally requires `spctl` to report `source=Notarized Developer ID` on the finished dmg; `build-release.bat`'s `:SignFile` errors unless `PATCHY_ALLOW_UNSIGNED=1` is set for a deliberately unsigned local build. Keep the escape hatches explicit and opt-in, and keep the safe behavior the default. Details and the `stapler validate` hang to avoid: [packaging/macos/README.md](../packaging/macos/README.md).

**Unverified uploads.** The desktop upload scripts called `%RT_PROJECTS%\UploadFileToRTsoftSSH.bat`, a bare `scp` whose exit code nobody checked, and `upload-to-rtsoft.bat` ran all four platforms unconditionally and exited 0 regardless. A refused connection or a truncated transfer was indistinguishable from a publish. Every release artifact now goes through `scripts\release\upload-one-file.bat`, which fails on a bad `scp` and then compares the local SHA-256 against one the server computes over what actually landed; `upload-to-rtsoft.bat` collects per-platform failures and ends with a named summary and a non-zero exit. Uploading a new artifact means calling that helper, not `scp` directly. (`upload-wasm-to-rtsoft.bat` predates it and does its own multi-file transfer plus a live COOP/COEP header check, which is why it stays separate.)

**Packages that cannot run headless.** `--headless` is a shipped feature, so a package missing the offscreen platform plugin is broken while its build log looks fine. `build-release.bat` copies `qwindows.dll` and `qoffscreen.dll` itself (`:CopyRequiredPlatformPlugins`; windeployqt deploys only the former) and then runs the staged `patchy.exe --headless --run-script` on a one-line script (`:HeadlessSmokeCheck`), failing unless the output ends in `[done]`. `packaging/macos/make-dmg.sh` copies `libqoffscreen.dylib` after macdeployqt and runs the same check on the staged bundle. `packaging/linux/make-flatpak.sh` runs it inside the built sandbox with `flatpak-builder --run` (the plugin comes from the org.kde.Platform runtime, so this is the check that the runtime still ships it; nothing is installed on glados). All three are fatal and run before any artifact is written. Note that `release-linux.ps1` builds with `-SkipTests`, so this smoke check is the only thing that executes the Flatpak on release day; the suites run natively on glados through `remote-build.ps1` during per-change verification.

After any upload, the claim "it shipped" needs evidence: the helper's `Verified <name> (sha256 ...)` line, or `curl -sI` against the public URL.

## The wasm (web) release

The web build ships with the desktop releases because the site redeploy is its only update mechanism (the in-app update check is stubbed out on wasm). Three scripts, all in `scripts\release` (plus `build-wasm-and-upload-to-rtsoft.bat`, a convenience wrapper that chains the build and upload scripts by full path and stops with an error, honoring `nopause`/`NO_PAUSE`, instead of uploading when the build fails):

- `build-wasm.bat` builds the `wasm-release` preset and stages only the deployable files into `build\package\wasm-site`: `patchy.js`, `patchy.wasm`, `patchy.data`, `qtloader.js`, their precompressed `.br`/`.gz` variants (written by `scripts\wasm\precompress-site.mjs` on the emsdk-bundled node; `.htaccess` serves them via `AddEncoding` plus `RemoveType` and IfModule-guarded rewrite rules keyed on Accept-Encoding and file existence, identity fallback without the modules, and `serve.mjs` mirrors the negotiation locally; first-visit transfer drops from ~92 MB to ~29 MB. The progress bar counts decompressed bytes, so the uncompressed wasm size is baked into the page as `__PATCHY_WASM_SIZE__` for the total; html stays identity-encoded), `patchy-logo.png` (the 256px Linux packaging icon), `NOTICE-THIRD-PARTY.md`, `libheif-COPYING.txt`, `.htaccess` (from `packaging\web`), and the shell page as both `patchy.html` and `index.html` (so `rtsoft.com/patchy/` serves the app directly). The notice and license copy are required by the browser build's LGPL libheif parser and must stay linked from the loading page. The homepage, GitHub source, and license links navigate the top-level page because the loading page may be inside the interface-scale iframe, where opening a new tab can be rejected by browser popup policy. The page is not Qt's generated shell: it is configured from `packaging\web\patchy.html.in`, which shows the Patchy logo, name, version, and a real download progress bar. The script substitutes `__PATCHY_VERSION__` (from CMakeLists.txt, same extraction as `build-release.bat`) and `__PATCHY_CACHE_TAG__` (version plus a build timestamp). Every asset URL in the page carries `?v=<cache tag>`, so each deploy busts browser caches; `.htaccess` marks the html `no-cache` (revalidated every load) and the tagged assets cacheable forever, with all directives IfModule-guarded so a host missing a module degrades instead of erroring. The staging directory is deleted up front, so a failed build leaves nothing for the upload script. `release-all.bat` runs this in its fourth console. The shell page's text is static html outside the Qt localization system and stays English.
- `start-local-wasm-server.bat` serves the staged `build\package\wasm-site` payload (the exact files an upload would publish) on `http://localhost:8973/` using the emsdk-bundled node and `scripts\wasm\serve.mjs`. An optional first argument overrides the port. It is safe to run repeatedly: it first frees the port through `scripts\wasm\free-server-port.ps1`, which stops a node server left listening by an earlier run (and waits for the socket to clear, since `Stop-Process` returns before the port is released) but reports and leaves any non-node process alone rather than killing someone else's program. Then it starts the server in the foreground, still Ctrl+C to stop, and `serve.mjs --open` hands the URL to the default browser from its `listen` callback, which is the only moment that cannot race the server. That helper is a separate `.ps1` and must stay one: cmd cannot parse literal parentheses inside a `for /f` backquote command, which PowerShell needs for subexpressions, so an inline one-liner dies with `( was unexpected at this time`. Error paths honor `NO_PAUSE`. For serving the raw `build\wasm-release` directory during development, use `start-local-wasm-test-server.bat` (same port-freeing, wraps `scripts\wasm\serve-app.ps1` passing `--open` through to the same `serve.mjs` browser-opening path, and serves `patchy.html` from Qt's generated shell rather than the branded one); the two scripts name each other in their headers because running the wrong one is otherwise an easy mistake to make.
- `upload-wasm-to-rtsoft.bat` verifies the staged files, creates `www/patchy` on the server, and uploads everything in one error-checked `scp` with the html files listed last, so a visitor loading mid-upload never gets new html pointing at assets that are not up yet. After the upload it curls the live site and fails loudly if the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` or `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` header is missing: the multithreaded build needs cross-origin isolation for SharedArrayBuffer, and the IfModule guard in `.htaccess` would otherwise drop the headers silently on a host without `mod_headers`. The same curl only warns when `Content-Encoding` is missing (identity serving still works, just slower). It talks to ssh/scp directly rather than through `UploadFileToRTsoftSSH.bat` (that helper is single-file and ignores transfer failures). It honors the same positional `nopause` argument as the other per-platform upload scripts, and `upload-to-rtsoft.bat` calls it after the desktop uploads.

There are no versioned wasm artifacts: the site serves stable names and a redeploy replaces them in place.

`build-wasm.bat` also builds the `wasm-release-st` preset and stages that single-threaded artifact under `st/` in the site directory (four files plus their precompressed variants; the page serves it to Safari/WebKit visitors, see [wasm.md](wasm.md) and [wasm-memory.md](wasm-memory.md); the uncompressed st wasm size is baked in as `__PATCHY_WASM_SIZE_ST__`). Both upload scripts create the remote `st/` directory and push that set before the main one, keeping the html files last overall. `build-wasm.bat` additionally stages the memory-diagnostics harness (`stress-harness.html` from `scripts\wasm`, cache-tag substituted, plus `memsoak.js`). The production upload list deliberately excludes the harness; `upload-wasm-to-rtsoft-beta.bat` publishes the same staged site plus the harness to the staging copy at `rtsoft.com/patchy-beta` (same nopause convention and COOP/COEP checks) for Safari/iOS device testing. The diagnostics workflow lives in [performance.md](performance.md).

## A running connector must not block the Windows relink

`build\release\patchy-mcp.exe` is usually running (the Codex app keeps one `--attach`
connector alive per thread for as long as the thread exists), which would make the release
preset's connector link fail with `LNK1104` and leave the package with a stale connector.
Never kill those clients. Since September 2026 the `patchy-mcp` target's PRE_LINK step
(`cmake/unlock_locked_executable.cmake`) handles it: a locked `patchy-mcp.exe` is renamed to
`patchy-mcp.stale-<timestamp>.exe` (Windows allows renaming a running image, and the
clients keep running from the renamed file), the build links a fresh `patchy-mcp.exe` that
the packager signs and stages, and every later connector link deletes stale copies that
nothing runs any more. Nothing manual is needed; `build-release.bat` runs through. Stale
copies are build artifacts under the housekeeping rule in AGENTS.md and must never be
packaged (the packager stages `patchy-mcp.exe` by name). The connector must not be copied
elsewhere to dodge the lock: its `--attach` socket name hashes the executable's own folder,
so a connector outside `build\release` cannot attach to a Patchy running from it.

## Batch files live in scripts\release and call their siblings by full path

The release and upload batch files live in `scripts\release`. Each derives the repo
root from its own location (`%~dp0..\..`) and cds there, so they run correctly from
any launch cwd, and `release-all.bat` reaches the mac/linux wrappers as
`%~dp0..\remote\release-*.bat`. Do not "simplify" those relative hops; they encode the
scripts' depth below the repo root.

`NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` is set in most non-interactive shells, including the
ones coding agents run commands in. It stops cmd from resolving a bare command name out of
the current directory, so `cmd /c "build-release.bat"` run from inside `scripts\release`
fails with `'build-release.bat' is not recognized` even when the file is right there. A
relative path that contains a separator, like `scripts\release\build-release.bat` from the
repo root, resolves fine, because cmd treats that as a path rather than a name to search
for.

That is why `release-all.bat` and `upload-to-rtsoft.bat` launch their siblings as
`"%~dp0name.bat"`; keep it that way (both files carry the same warning as comments). A
bare-name launch dies instantly before the delete-previous-artifacts step, leaving the
previous version's zip and installer in `build\package` for the newest-file upload
scripts to pick up.

Inside a parenthesized block such as `if errorlevel 1 ( ... )`, an unescaped `)` in
echo text closes the block early, and the resulting "was unexpected at this time" is a
fatal parse error that ends the whole calling chain, including `upload-to-rtsoft.bat`
and any wrapper around it, before the later platforms run (September 2026: the Linux and
mac failure messages said "(or was left in a bad state)", so the first failed hash
silently ended the release upload). cmd parses the entire block when it reaches the
`if`, so the bug fires even when the condition is false. Escape as `^)` or reword.

## scripts\vs-env.bat, not VsDevCmd.bat

Every build entry point (`scripts\release\build-release.bat`, `scripts\run-tests.ps1`,
`scripts\make-readme-screenshots.ps1`, the handoff command in AGENTS.md) enters the
developer environment through `scripts\vs-env.bat`, which forwards its arguments to
VsDevCmd.bat. It is the only place that knows where Visual Studio is installed, and it
prepends the VS Installer directory to `PATH` before the call.

That `PATH` line is what silences the spurious `'vswhere.exe' is not recognized` message
(harmless, but it reads exactly like a real failure in a release log; the full mechanism
is explained in `scripts\vs-env.bat`'s own comments). Do not chase that message if some
other caller prints it: check whether that caller went through vs-env.bat.

## Agent/non-interactive runs: NO_PAUSE

**Agent/non-interactive release runs must set `NO_PAUSE=1` before launching the batch files.** From PowerShell in the repo root, set `$env:NO_PAUSE='1'` and then run `cmd /c scripts\release\release-all.bat`; the environment is inherited by the three `start`ed consoles and, critically, by `%RT_PROJECTS%\Signing\sign.bat`, which otherwise pauses after EVERY signed Windows file. Do this before the first launch, not after a signing prompt appears.

`release-mac.bat` and `release-linux.bat` have their own unconditional final `pause`, so do not wait for those wrapper `cmd.exe` processes to exit: determine success from the child PowerShell completion and fresh versioned artifacts, then close the completed wrapper consoles.

To keep evidence of each builder's result, an agent run can launch the same four scripts `release-all.bat` starts, each through a small wrapper batch file that redirects the builder's output to a log and then writes `%ERRORLEVEL%` to a marker file (call `release-mac.ps1` and `release-linux.ps1` directly there, since their `.bat` wrappers pause). Start each wrapper with `start "<title>" /min /belownormal cmd /c "<wrapper>"` so the whole tree inherits below-normal priority, and set `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=6` alongside `NO_PAUSE=1` so `cmake --build` inside the scripts is throttled as AGENTS.md requires. Do not capture exit codes with Windows PowerShell 5.1's `Start-Process -PassThru` while redirecting output: its `ExitCode` comes back empty there (pwsh 7 is fine). Inside those wrappers invoke the test binaries as `.\patchy_core_tests.exe`, a path, never by bare name: `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` applies to them too, and a bare name exits 9009 (`not recognized`) after `cd /d build\release` (September 2026, 0.93 run).

Launch the release batch files from cmd or Windows PowerShell, not from pwsh 7 (or reset `PSModulePath` first to `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules;%ProgramFiles%\WindowsPowerShell\Modules;%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules`). pwsh 7 puts its own module directories on `PSModulePath`, and the `powershell` 5.1 one-liners inside the scripts then load pwsh's incompatible `Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility`, so `Get-FileHash` is "not recognized" and `upload-one-file.bat` refuses every desktop upload (September 2026). The build scripts happened to survive because they only use cmdlets from other modules.

`scripts\release\upload-to-rtsoft.bat` itself does not read `NO_PAUSE`: it already passes the positional `nopause` argument to the per-platform upload scripts, but the top-level script ends in one final unconditional `pause`, which an automated runner must dismiss (feed Enter) after all uploads complete.

Do not say a release was created unless the release preset build completed successfully.
