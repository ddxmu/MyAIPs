# Windows Packaging

Planned release shape:

- Build with MSVC 2022.
- Bundle Qt runtime dependencies using `windeployqt`.
- Sign binaries and installer.
- Produce a simple local per-user installer, with WiX Toolset or a commercial installer system still available later if project requirements grow.
- Generate optional MSIX after core installer behavior stabilizes.

## Local package artifacts

Run the release script from a Developer Command Prompt or regular `cmd.exe` in the repo root:

```bat
scripts\release\build-release.bat
```

The script configures and builds the `release` preset, deploys the Qt runtime, stages runtime files under `build\package\staging\Patchy`, and creates:

```text
build\package\PatchyWindowsNoInstaller.zip
build\package\PatchyWindowsInstaller.exe
```

`PatchyWindowsNoInstaller.zip` contains a top-level `Patchy` folder. Users can drag that folder to the desktop or another writable location and run `patchy.exe` from there.

`PatchyWindowsInstaller.exe` is built with Windows IExpress from the zip payload plus installer-only helper executables. It opens a small per-user setup wizard, installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Patchy`, creates a Start Menu shortcut, offers a default-checked desktop shortcut, registers a Windows uninstall entry under the current user, and offers to launch Patchy when setup finishes.

The package is intentionally limited to the files needed by end users:

- `patchy.exe`
- `Patchy.ico` and `PatchyInstallManifest.txt`
- Qt DLLs for Core, GUI, Widgets, PrintSupport, Network, SVG, and the Qt ImageFormats plugins
- the Windows and offscreen platform plugins (offscreen is what `--headless` loads; the script smoke-tests the staged tree headless before zipping), current Windows style plugin, SVG icon engine, TLS backend, and JPEG, SVG, TIFF, and WebP image plugins
- app-local Microsoft Visual C++ runtime DLLs copied from the local Visual Studio redist CRT directory
- app and Qt base translations for every shipped language (German, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Simplified and Traditional Chinese) under `translations`
- bundled compatibility fonts under `fonts`
- `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE-THIRD-PARTY.md`, and Qt module SPDX notices under `licenses\qt`

The zip does not include build files, tests, test fixtures, Qt translations for languages Patchy does not ship, Qt generic input plugins, installer-only helpers such as `InstallPatchy.exe` and `UninstallPatchy.exe`, the Visual C++ Redistributable installer, or developer packaging notes.

The installer copies a signed `UninstallPatchy.exe` into the installed app folder and records it in `PatchyInstallManifest.txt`. The uninstaller uses that manifest to remove only files installed by the package. If a user saves documents into the install directory, those files are left in place and the install directory remains until the user removes them.

When Seth's local signing setup is available, the script signs `build\release\patchy.exe` before staging it, signs `InstallPatchy.exe` and `UninstallPatchy.exe` before IExpress packs them, and signs `build\package\PatchyWindowsInstaller.exe` after IExpress creates it:

- `RT_PROJECTS` must point at the RT projects root.
- The script calls `%RT_PROJECTS%\Signing\sign.bat "%EXE%" "Patchy" "rtsoft.com"`.
- Signature verification uses `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.26100.0\x64\signtool.exe`.

If `RT_PROJECTS` or the signing script is missing, the build fails. Set `PATCHY_ALLOW_UNSIGNED=1` for a deliberately unsigned local build (see `docs/release-process.md`).

Publishing automation and a CI signing pipeline are not implemented yet; the current local handoff artifacts are the zip package and installer executable, with `latest_version.json` providing update metadata for published builds.
