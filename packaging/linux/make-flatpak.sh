# inside the sandbox. flatpak-builder --run uses the build directory the bundle is
# exported from, so nothing is installed on the build machine. --headless never
# forwards to a running Patchy; PATCHY_SETTINGS_DIR keeps the run out of the real
# settings; the temp directory lives under $HOME because that is what the sandbox
# can see. The same check runs in the Windows and macOS packagers.
