"""Krita driver: the documented headless CLI export path.

`krita.com <in> --export --export-filename <out>` renders through Krita's own
compositor; the output format follows the extension (PNG render, PSD resave).
The console shim prints nothing through pipes on this machine, so success is
judged by exit code plus output existence.
