<#
Builds the distributable Linux Flatpak bundle from the current working tree and copies
it into build\package\ next to the Windows artifacts.

  scripts\remote\release-linux.ps1

Flow: snapshot push (scripts\remote\remote-build.ps1 -SkipTests validates the tree
still builds against the aqt Qt), then packaging/linux/make-flatpak.sh on glados
(flatpak-builder against org.kde.Platform//6.8 -> flatpak build-bundle), then scp the
bundle back. One-time glados setup is in the make-flatpak.sh header (needs
flatpak/flatpak-builder via apt).
